# Galaga

This project was given to me as my class project during my Post Graduate.

I was asked to replicate the original game GALAGA by using sprite-kit as game engine in IOS.
Player has 3 lives and hase to shoot down the alien ships who are coming towards the player in the space. They also move in random pattern.
Player also gets a special weapon in the game and game also keeps tab the score.

May be for better understanding you may refer to commits which will give you idea what things are implemented.
